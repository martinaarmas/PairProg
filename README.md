### TASKS

- Add code that performs a verification test when the value “-1” is passed to the program as an argument
(5 points)
- Why don’t we choose the word “test” as an argument to activate the test?
Passing an argument as "test" would make a search through the sorted dictionary instead of making a comparison between files.
- Check with several words that the position matches (5 points)
- Performs a full test of the 10,000 words (10 points)
- Performance test (25 points)
- Place several timers to control what time it takes to do certain tasks. Do printouts to see that info on the
console (5 points)
- Since some tasks take a variable amount of time, calculate the average, maximum and minimum of
certain tasks to have a better understanding of the limitations of our algorithms (10 points)
- Find bottlenecks and fix them (10 points)
- Check against different inputs (10 points)
- Inputs not expected
- Numbers beyond the limits
- etc
